9. Limitations
- User cannot open the main website without logging in.
- Javascript is not used for the Filteration task, rather I have used PHP for the same.
- Some of the pages are not responsive ,so they may not load properly in small devices.

10. Summary
- While making this project, I learned a lot of things. Starting from the skeleton, I learned some tags and attributes of HTML which I didnt knew before. I got to know   the uses of CSS Properties like Flex and Grid. Before making this project, I didn't knew how PHP is used in the back end and how it is linked with the Database, bt     now I know how to do it and I also did the filteration of the tasks using PHP.
