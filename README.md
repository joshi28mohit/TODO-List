# 8. Limitations 
<ul>
<li>User cannot open the main website without logging in.</li>
<li>Javascript is not used for the Filtration task, rather I have used PHP for the same.</li>
<li>Some of the pages are not responsive ,so they may not load properly in small devices.</li>
</ul>

# 9. Summary/Things I learned

While making this project, I learned a lot of things. Starting from the skeleton, I learned some tags and attributes of HTML which I didnt knew before. I got to know the uses of CSS Properties like Flex and Grid. Before making this project, I didn't knew how PHP is used in the back end and how it is linked with the Database, bt now I know how to do it and I also did the filtration of the tasks using PHP.
